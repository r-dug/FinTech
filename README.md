# FinTech
For anyone interested in learning about FinTech and programmatic trading, and improving accessibility to related tools and information. 

I'm interested in learning about the world of FinTech, and spreading knowledge to as many people as possible. Specifically, I want to create tools for every day users to create and implement trading and investing strategies. The tools should enable users to execute their strategies programmatically. Results should be simple to observe, and the strategies simple to customize/adjust. For the sake of improving the financial independence of anyone interested- this repository will remain public.
